// We require the Hardhat Runtime Environment explicitly here. This is optional
// but useful for running the script in a standalone fashion through `node <script>`.
//
// When running the script with `npx hardhat run <script>` you'll find the Hardhat
// Runtime Environment's members available in the global scope.
// This import/require is not required because when we execute `npx hardhat run <script>` then the `hre` object is built on the fly using the
// hardhat.config.js specified in our code. Hence we would never have to import it in the files.
// Refer: https://hardhat.org/advanced/hardhat-runtime-environment.html
